TASK
  Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array.
  It must use the bubble sort methodology.

PARAMETERS
  @param integers [Array] The array of integers to be sorted in ascending order. 

RETURNS
  @return [Array] The array of integers now sorted in ascending order. 

EXAMPLE
  bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
  => [0,2,2,3,4,78]

NOTES
  - The worst case scenario for the bubble sort algorithm requires 
    a number of pass-throughs equal to the number of elements (n)-1.

  - Even once the array has been correctly sorted, the algorithm 
    must still perform one final pass-through without
    encountering any swaps before returning the sorted array. 
    This is necessary to verify that no further sorting is required. 

  - It can be observed that following (k) pass-throughs of the array,
    the last (k) elements will be sorted in their correct position. 
    Therefore, the algorithm can be optimized by not evaluating those 
    elements on future pass-throughs.
